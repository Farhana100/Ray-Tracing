# Ray-Tracing

This project is an implementation of realistic image generation of 3D geometric shapes using ray tracing with appropiate illumination techniques. This process encompasses casting rays from a virtual camera (eye) through each pixel, determining intersections with geometric shapes, and calculating lighting contributions. Illumination techniques, including ambient lighting, diffuse and specular reflection, shadows, and global illumination, are used for achieving realism. Specific algorithms for each geometric shape are implemented to determine ray-surface intersections. To enhance realism, considerations for materials, textures, and advanced effects like reflections are incorporated, providing a visually accurate representation of the simulated scene.
